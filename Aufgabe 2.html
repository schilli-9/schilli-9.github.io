<p> <h1>Segway`n USA</h1> </p>
<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway! </p>
<p><h2> August 20, 2012</h2></p>

<p> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chnace, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM</p>
<p><h2> July 14, 2012</h2></p>
<p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can´t see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won´t be passing any cars.</p>

<p>My first day of the trip! I can´t believe finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I´m on a Segway, I wasn´t able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Loa Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles one Segway."</p>
